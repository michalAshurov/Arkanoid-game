# Arkanoid Game 🎮

A Java implementation of the classic **Arkanoid / Breakout** game, developed as a personal project using object-oriented programming principles and a custom-built game engine.

## About the Project
This project was built to strengthen my understanding of core software engineering concepts, including clean object-oriented design, event-driven programming, and real-time collision handling.

The game includes a paddle, ball, and breakable blocks, with interactive gameplay and visual customization.

## Key Features
- Object-Oriented Design (OOP)
- Collision detection and response
- Event listeners for keyboard input
- Modular and extensible game architecture
- Custom game loop and rendering logic

## Technologies
- **Java**
- Custom graphics and event handling (Java-based)

## What I Learned
- Designing and structuring a multi-class project
- Managing real-time interactions and game loops
- Applying OOP principles in a non-trivial project
- Debugging and refining interactive behavior

## Notes
This project was created as part of my learning journey in software development and serves as a foundation for more advanced projects.
